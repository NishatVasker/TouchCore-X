Auto detect which sensor is ATTACHED without programming

This project proposes a self-configurable, battery-powered ESP32-based IoT platform that can automatically adapt its functionality based on the peripherals connected to it, without requiring firmware modification or reprogramming. The system integrates an ESP32 microcontroller, a TFT display with optional touch support, onboard battery charging and power management, and a set of exposed general-purpose input/output (GPIO) expansion ports. These expansion ports are intentionally designed to support a predefined ecosystem of sensors and modules.

When the device powers on, the firmware executes a peripheral detection and identification routine. Using standard techniques such as I²C address scanning, GPIO signal probing, analog identification through resistor encoding, and optional user-assisted confirmation, the system determines which sensors or modules are attached to the available ports. Based on the detected peripherals, the device dynamically configures its internal logic, user interface, and system behavior. For example, if a temperature sensor is detected, the display automatically presents temperature data; if a relay module is connected, corresponding control options appear on the screen; if multiple sensors are present, the interface reorganizes itself to display all relevant information.

The same hardware platform can therefore function as multiple products—such as a smart alarm clock, environmental monitoring station, IoT controller, data logger, or sensor hub—solely through automatic peripheral recognition and software reconfiguration. Power optimization is integrated into the system, allowing unused subsystems (such as touch input, display backlight, or wireless connectivity) to be selectively disabled based on detected hardware and operating context, improving battery life and reliability.

The novelty of this project lies not in the individual hardware components, but in the method and system-level behavior that enable automatic hardware identification, functional reassignment, and interface generation within a constrained embedded device. This makes the platform reusable, scalable, and suitable for rapid product development, educational use, and future commercialization, while also forming a strong foundation for intellectual property protection focused on adaptive embedded system behavior.
