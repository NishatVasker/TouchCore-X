# TouchCore-X
An open hardware ESP32 IoT device showcasing real-world PCB design, power management, and firmware development.
TouchCore is a custom-designed, battery-powered ESP32-based IoT device featuring a TFT display and optional touch input.
This repository documents the complete hardware and firmware development lifecycle of the project, including schematic design, PCB layout, power architecture, firmware implementation, testing, and real-world validation.

The device is designed around an ESP32-WROOM module, powered exclusively via a regulated 3.3V rail derived from a Li-ion battery with onboard charging support. It integrates an ILI9341 SPI TFT display, optional XPT2046 touch controller, and Wi-Fi connectivity for interactive and connected applications.

This repository serves as a living project log, where all revisions, design decisions, test results, known issues, and improvements are transparently documented. It is intended to help engineers, students, and makers understand how a real-world embedded IoT device evolves from concept to working hardware.
